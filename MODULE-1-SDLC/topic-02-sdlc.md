## 1. What is SDLC?
SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) is the process used to design, develop, test, deploy, and maintain software.

It provides:
- Structure
- Predictability
- Quality assurance

---

## 2. SDLC Phases
1. **Requirement Gathering** – Understand what needs to be built  
2. **Analysis** – Feasibility, technical analysis  
3. **Design** – System architecture, UI/UX design  
4. **Development** – Coding  
5. **Testing** – Validation, bug fixing  
6. **Deployment** – Releasing to production  
7. **Maintenance** – Improvements, updates, and support

## 3. SDLC Models
There are various ways teams execute SDLC. Commonly used models:

### 3.1 Waterfall Model
A linear and sequential approach.  
**Flow:**
Requirements → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance

**Pros:** Simple, structured, well-documented  
**Cons:** Rigid, no early feedback, changes are expensive

---

### 3.2 Agile Model
An iterative and flexible model based on sprints.

**Flow:**
Plan → Develop → Test → Review → Repeat

**Pros:** Fast delivery, flexible, continuous feedback  
**Cons:** Requires skilled teams, less documentation

---

### 3.3 Lean Methodology
Focused on efficiency and waste reduction.

**Principles:**
- Eliminate waste  
- Deliver fast  
- Build quality in  
- Optimize workflow

## 4. Waterfall vs Agile vs Lean

| Feature              | Waterfall            | Agile           | Lean             |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Approach             | Sequential           | Iterative       | Value-driven     |
| Flexibility          | Low                  | High            | High             |
| Delivery             | One-time release     | Incremental     | Continuous flow  |
| Documentation        | Heavy                | Moderate        | Light            |
| Customer Involvement | Low                  | Very high       | Moderate         |
| Best For             | Predictable projects | Frequent change | Efficiency focus |

## 5. Summary
Understanding SDLC and its models is essential for DevOps because DevOps works *alongside* SDLC to automate, streamline, and shorten delivery cycles.
