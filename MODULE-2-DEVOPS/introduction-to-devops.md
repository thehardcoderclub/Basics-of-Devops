# Module 2 – DevOps
## Topic 2: Introduction to DevOps

---

## 1. Why DevOps?
Before DevOps, teams faced:
- Slow release cycles
- Miscommunication between Dev & Ops
- Manual deployments
- Frequent production issues
- Delayed feedback loops

**DevOps emerged to fix these gaps** by combining development + operations with automation and collaboration.

---

## 2. What is DevOps?
DevOps is a culture, methodology, and set of practices that integrate:

**Development (Dev)** + **Operations (Ops)**

DevOps aims to:
- Automate everything
- Deliver faster and frequently
- Improve product stability
- Reduce manual effort
- Encourage collaboration
- Provide continuous feedback

**Important:**  
DevOps is NOT a tool — it is a *way of working* supported by tools.

## 3. DevOps Lifecycle
The DevOps lifecycle is continuous and automated:

Plan → Code → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor → Feedback

### Explanation:
- **Plan:** Define requirements  
- **Code:** Developers write code  
- **Build:** CI tools compile/build  
- **Test:** Automated tests  
- **Release:** Package the application  
- **Deploy:** Push to production  
- **Operate:** System runs live  
- **Monitor:** Alerts, logs, metrics  
- **Feedback:** Improves next cycle

## 4. How DevOps Works
DevOps works through:
- Continuous Integration (CI)
- Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)
- Automation of repetitive tasks
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Monitoring & feedback loops
- Collaboration between teams
